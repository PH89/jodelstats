# Jodel Stats

This is the source code for jodelstats.com, which is a small web app that shows the most popular posts on [Jodel](jodel-app.com) in Germany.

### How does this web app work?
This web app communicates with the Jodel servers to obtain the most popular posts in various cities. The city names and coordinates are saved in the database. The front end is just some Bootstrap magic.

### I want feature X!
If you have any suggestions or if you would like to reach out to me, feel free to message me on [Twitter](twitter.com/ppati000) or send me an [e-mail](mailto:ppati000@me.com).

### Can I contribute to this thing?
Yes, of course! The process is as follows:
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Push your changes
4. Create a pull request

### Todo
- Internationalization
- View more posts from one city
- Search function
- Anything else you like
